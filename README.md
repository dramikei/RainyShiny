# RainyShiny
A Simple Weather app that uses Alamofire to retrieve weather data from OpenWeather API

# How does it work?
The app uses the user's current location and retrieves the weather data of that area from the Open Weather API in the form of JSON and then parses it to scrape the data which is useful.


# Credits
